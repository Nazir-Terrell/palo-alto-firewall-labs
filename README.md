# 🔥 Palo Alto Firewall Configuration & Security Labs

## 📌 Project Overview
This project contains a full suite of hands-on labs simulating enterprise firewall deployment using Palo Alto Networks technology. Topics include system setup, security policies, high availability, packet inspection, encrypted traffic handling, and administrator role configuration. All labs were performed in a virtual training environment designed to mirror production-level scenarios.

> 🛡️ This repo showcases security-focused tasks ranging from Nmap network scanning to deep packet inspection and log analysis, with both GUI- and CLI-based workflows.
